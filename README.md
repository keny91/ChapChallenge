Coding challenge / by Luis Herranz

The following documents should be reviewed:

CameraTop.ipynb     	<- Board segmentation assignment
CameraBottom.ipynb	<- Scratch/cracks assignment
Source1_CommentedByLuis <- Commented C++ code


To be able to run the Jupyter books, the following libs shoulb be installed in the environment:
*numpy
*cv2 - opencv2
*matplotlib
*sklearn

A final note:

I did not have time to build a binary file for unit testing. 
You can however add any images to the indicated folder in the CameraTop.ipynb to test other images.
The scratch assingment is slightly more complex 


If any issues or complications arise while testing, please, do contact me at either:
